# UAV-Image-Processing-For-Soybean-Detection-Using-MATLAB
This project focuses on using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) image processing techniques to detect diseases in soybean crops. Implemented in MATLAB, the project aims to identify and classify soybean leaf diseases through advanced image processing and machine learning methods. By analyzing aerial images captured by UAVs, the system helps in early detection of crop diseases, enabling timely interventions for better crop management and yield improvement.
